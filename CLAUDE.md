# CLAUDE.md

Procedural voxel world generator for a bounded disc world. Full design in
`docs/worldgen-design.md` — read it before changing anything in `worldgen/`.

## Layout

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `worldgen/shaders/` | The field function. Ordinary C++ that also compiles as HLSL. |
| `worldgen/world.{h,cpp}` | Cell scatter, per-feature seeding, world build, carved terrain. |
| `worldgen/assign/` | Quota assignment (layer 3). Portable C++, no host deps. |
| `worldgen/data/` | `archetypes.json` — the biome table. All tuning lives here. |
| `worldgen/golden/` | Pinned seed hashes. Changes must be deliberate. |
| `tools/validate/` | Headless N-seed harness. CI entry point. |
| `tools/view/` | Native world viewer (Win32). Debug tool, Windows only. |
| `tools/shared/` | Presentation, shared by the harness and the viewer. |
| `engine/` | Track B runtime (D3D12, `docs/adr-003-*`). Built against the TRIVIAL field in `engine/field/`, never `worldgen/`, until M1. |

**`worldgen/` is everything upstream of the golden hash; `tools/` is
everything downstream.** That line is what makes invariant 9 checkable — the
metrics legitimately use `atan`, and they are on the far side of it.

## Build

```bash
tools\validate\build.bat && build\validate.exe
```

```bash
build\view.exe
```

```bash
build\engine.exe
```

`build.bat` is a thin wrapper over cmake and builds everything; there is no
`CMakePresets.json`, and the `cmake --preset dev` line that used to be here had
never worked. To drive cmake directly:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build/cmake -G Ninja && cmake --build build/cmake
```

`validate.exe`, `view.exe` and `engine.exe` all read data by paths relative to
the repository root, so run them from there. `engine.exe --shot <path>` renders
one frame at a fixed camera and writes a BMP without opening a window.

## Invariants — breaking one of these is a bug, not a tradeoff

1. `worldgen/` imports nothing from `tools/` or `engine/`.
2. The field function is ORDINARY C++ that also compiles as HLSL behind
   `worldgen/shaders/field_types.h`. Every function carries `WG_FN` — `inline`
   in C++, empty in HLSL — because more than one translation unit includes
   these headers. Structs are fine and preferred over long scalar argument
   lists. Only the builtins declared in `field_types.h`, which invariant 9
   explains. Kernel code (`surface_nets`, anything with workgroup memory,
   atomics or barriers) stays hand-written per backend: it never needs CPU
   evaluation, so it gains nothing from being shared.
   There is no WGSL and no generator. That was ADR-001's one bet, taken given
   a browser prototype; `docs/adr-002-*` retires it along with the prototype.
   ADR-001's other decisions stand, including why a GPU can never anchor a
   golden hash.
3. Noise is an analytic integer hash. Never a permutation texture — those are
   not bit-reproducible across our two backends.
4. Per-feature seeds: `hash64(world_seed ^ FEATURE_ID)`. Never thread one RNG
   through the layers in order.
5. Base terrain is never stored. The edit store holds player edits only, as
   ABSOLUTE density + material, never as deltas against the base function.
6. World coordinates are centred on the origin: ±R, never 0..2R.
7. No biome names in shader or engine code. The generator reads
   `archetypes.json` and knows nothing about meaning.
8. Never compile the field function with fast-math. FMA contraction breaks
   CPU/GPU parity. The C++ build (`/fp:precise`, `-ffp-contract=off`) is the
   determinism authority: golden hashes come from it, and CPU-to-GPU agreement
   is a TOLERANCE comparison, never a hash. Shader languages permit
   reassociation and fusion at the implementation's discretion — WGSL §15.7.5
   says so outright, and HLSL needs per-expression `precise` to pin anything —
   so an exact check against a GPU is impossible whichever backend ships.
9. EVERYTHING THAT FEEDS THE GOLDEN HASH uses only `+ - * /`, `sqrt`, `floor`
   and comparisons — the field function AND the layer-2 scatter AND layer 3.
   No `pow`, `exp`, `log`, `sin`, `cos` or `atan`: libm is not exactly
   specified and glibc disagrees with the MSVC CRT by an ULP.
   It is not a theoretical worry. `cos`/`sin` in the cell scatter moved cell
   positions by an ULP, which was far too little to change which cell is
   nearest but enough to perturb the layer-4 blend weights, which moved a
   height across a quantum, which moved a river. Three golden seeds in eight,
   and versions 1 and 2 had passed CI *by luck* because the heights happened
   not to straddle a quantum. Only the two-OS matrix ever catches this.
   For directions use rejection sampling normalised with `sqrt`; for shape
   curves use a rational like `flatness_curve` in `worldgen/shaders/field.h`.
   Metrics that never reach the hash (the slope check's `atan`) are exempt.

## Gotchas that have bitten us

- Radial quantities are defined on normalised AREA (r²), not normalised radius.
  Disc area grows as r², so equal-width rings are not equal-area rings
  (`r_k = R * sqrt(k/N)`). Using radius silently skews every biome quota.
- Octave count must fall with voxel size, at the Nyquist limit, with the last
  surviving octave faded rather than cut. Otherwise LOD levels disagree and
  terrain visibly morphs as you approach it.
- Blend heights across biome boundaries, never noise parameters. Interpolating
  octave counts and lacunarity produces mush exactly where the player is looking.
- Changing any generator parameter changes the world. If golden hashes move,
  either revert or bump `generator_version` — saves store edits anchored to the
  base terrain, and a silent change corrupts them.

## Testing

`tools/validate` runs 200 seeds and exits non-zero on any failure. It asserts
presence, quota, radial ordering, land fraction, adjacency, edge taper, home
landmass, boat connectivity, spawn, slope budget, river sanity, LOD agreement,
cave entrances, throughput and the golden hashes, and emits a 64-seed contact
sheet — look at it. Automated checks cannot tell you whether a world is
interesting.

It also *measures and prints* **islandness** — landmass count, and the share
of land on the spawn landmass — and asserts nothing about it. That is
deliberate. An earlier `foot connect` check asserted ≥75% of land be walkable
from spawn, which made a single continent a pass condition and forbade the
island clusters layer 3 is specified to produce; the design doc had left the
threshold as a literal `X%`. Whether a world should read as one continent or
an archipelago is a feel call made on the contact sheet, not an assertion.
`tools/validate/README.md` §8 has the measurement. **Land fraction is the
lever** (`--land-target`, `--land-sweep`, and a slider in `view.exe` reading in
percent). It is now a **35% mean** — below the percolation threshold, so a
typical seed is an archipelago of about 7 landmasses with the spawn mass
holding roughly three quarters of the land, and the worst seeds far less.
The offset behind it is solved GLOBALLY for the mean and baked as a literal:
solving per seed would flatten the spread the islandness comes from.

It also emits a shaded-relief sheet with `--relief`, and a single seed rendered
large with `--closeup <seed>`. Use the close-up for anything narrower than a
few hundred metres: a contact-sheet tile is ~87 m per pixel, so rivers are
sub-pixel there and an axis-aligned drainage network looked perfectly fine on
it.

**LOD agreement is asserted.** Octave weights fall to zero between four and
two voxels of period, faded rather than cut, and the harness checks that
every LOD from 0.5 m to 64 m matches LOD 0 within its own voxel size. The
worst case is currently 0.41 of a voxel. Normalise by the FULL amplitude,
never the faded one: rescaling the survivors changes the shape of what
remains, which is the thing LOD agreement forbids.

Note what the check does and does not catch. Cutting octaves ten times too
early takes it to 4.09 and fails, so it bites on over-aggressive dropping.
It did NOT notice normalising by the faded amplitude, because that error is
smaller than the worst case already present — it is a guard against the loud
version of the bug, not the quiet one.

**The golden hash cannot see everything, and layer 7 proved it.** The hash
samples a 1024² grid — one density sample per 156 m — and a world has ~24
entrance shafts a few metres across. Adding the whole layer left all eight
hashes byte for byte unchanged, which would have left every entrance free to
drift through CI. The shaft buffer is now hashed directly. The general rule:
**a layer whose features are smaller than the hash grid is invisible to it and
must be pinned by its buffer.** Layer 5 escapes this only because 428 river
segments per seed carve a wide enough area to land in the samples.

The hash still does not see whether the shafts are *open*: disabling
`entrance_carve` entirely leaves the stored geometry, and so the hash,
unchanged. That is what the `cave entrances` check is for. Neither covers the
layer alone — both mutants were tested.

**Golden hashes are pinned.** Any change to `worldgen/` moves them and the run
fails. That is the gate working: either revert, or bump `generator_version` in
`worldgen/golden/golden.json` and re-pin with `build\validate.exe --bless`.
Never re-bless to make a red build green without deciding the world should
move.

Run it before any commit touching `worldgen/`.

## Style

- Shaders: `snake_case`. C++: the existing style in `engine/`. TS: the eslint config.
- Prefer data in `archetypes.json` over constants in code.
- Commit in logical steps, with messages explaining why rather than what.
